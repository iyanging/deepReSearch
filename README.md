‼️WARNING‼️: This project is currently in early stage

## Reflection during development

### We may need Receptionist, to directly respond greetings

### Simple question or task should be allowed to bypass the standard lengthy procedure

### Should consider topic derivation in early procedure?

### Is an useless document content really useless? Maybe LLM currently have not enough knowledge to judge

### Should LLM explain why a document is useless?
